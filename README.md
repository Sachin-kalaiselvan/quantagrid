> A React-based prototype exploring adaptive AI systems and mesh networking concepts, inspired by Google's Gemma 3n MatFormer architecture.

## 🎯 Project Overview

QuantaGrid is an educational prototype that demonstrates concepts around adaptive AI systems and distributed networking. The project explores what could happen if AI systems were designed to work in offline, distributed environments - particularly during emergency situations when traditional centralized systems might fail.

## 💡 The Problem This Explores

Recent events have highlighted vulnerabilities in centralized AI systems:
- Turkey's 2023 earthquake: Early warning systems had significant limitations
- Infrastructure outages affecting emergency services
- Network failures impacting critical communications

This project asks: **"What if AI systems could adapt and continue working even when primary infrastructure fails?"**

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend:** React 18.2 with modern hooks and state management
- **Styling:** Custom CSS with animations and responsive design
- **Concepts Demonstrated:** 
  - Adaptive model selection (simulated)
  - Mesh network visualization
  - Emergency response simulation
  - Real-time performance monitoring

### Architecture Overview

```javascript
// Conceptual implementation of adaptive AI system
const QuantaGridApp = () => {
  const [currentModel, setCurrentModel] = useState('Gemma-3n-Light');
  const [meshNodes, setMeshNodes] = useState(6);
  const [emergencyActive, setEmergencyActive] = useState(false);
  
  // Simulates adaptive behavior based on conditions
  const adaptToConditions = () => {
    if (emergencyActive) {
      // Switch to more efficient model
      // Activate mesh networking protocols
      // Optimize for emergency response
    }
  };
};
```

### Key Features Demonstrated

   - Real-time metrics during simulated emergencies
   - Performance improvement visualization

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Live metrics dashboard
   - Responsive progress bars and animations
   - System health indicators

## 🎓 Competition Context

This project was created for the Google Gemma 3n Impact Challenge, exploring how Gemma 3n's architectural innovations could be applied to emergency response scenarios. The competition encouraged participants to think about AI systems that can make a positive impact on the world.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Disclaimers

- This is a conceptual prototype, not a production emergency system
- The "AI models" are simulated - no actual Gemma 3n inference is performed
- Mesh networking is visualized but not actually implemented
- Performance metrics are illustrative, not based on real measurements
- This should not be relied upon for actual emergency situations
